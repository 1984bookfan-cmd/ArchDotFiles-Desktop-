The Waybar is optimized for my displays, I haven't really optimized the code to be able to fit perfectly for every screen. Alterations to the exact dimensions will be needed to made. 

You can alt (right-click) on the: clock, cpu, cputemp, RAM usage, and network, for a more detailed view of those services. 
Alt clicking just right to the clock brings up your typical weather report. 

Again this is a very rough config that I plan on fixing later down the line, but for now here it is.
